> __What is Infura and why do I need a Project ID?__
>
> By using Infura you don't have to worry about syncing the blockchain on your own system. You can simply access all test networks and the Ethereum mainnet through the API endpoints provided by Infura.
>
>The Raiden Wizard sets up a Raiden node on top of Infura and your Project ID works as a way to authenticate your access to Infura.

## Handle Issues
The Raiden Wizard is in an early stage of implementation. In this section you will learn how to handle known issues.

> __Important__
